The Hierarchical Transformer-Boost RL Framework for Dynamic Multi-Asset Portfolio Optimization

üìå Overview

This project proposes a Hierarchical Transformer-Boost Reinforcement Learning (RL) Framework for Dynamic Multi-Asset Portfolio Optimization. It combines the power of transformer-based sequence modeling, boosting techniques, and hierarchical reinforcement learning to achieve adaptive, robust, and scalable portfolio allocation strategies.

By leveraging market signals, historical price sequences, and multi-level decision hierarchies, the framework optimizes asset allocation dynamically while addressing the challenges of non-stationarity, volatility clustering, and high-dimensional financial environments.

üöÄ Key Features

Hierarchical Decision-Making

Coarse-to-fine strategy decomposition (macro allocation ‚Üí micro asset selection).

Transformer-Based Market Representation

Captures long-term temporal dependencies and complex market patterns.

Boosted Reinforcement Learning

Enhances learning stability and reduces variance with ensemble-based training.

Dynamic Multi-Asset Optimization

Handles real-time portfolio rebalancing with multiple risk-adjusted objectives.

Risk-Aware Training

Incorporates Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and drawdown minimization as reward functions.

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing

Multi-asset time series data (stocks, ETFs, crypto, bonds).

Feature engineering (returns, volatility, momentum, macro indicators).

Normalization & rolling-window segmentation.

2. Hierarchical Framework

High-Level Policy: Asset class allocation (equity, fixed income, commodities, crypto).

Low-Level Policy: Individual asset selection within each class.

3. Transformer-Boost Representation

Transformer encoder-decoder for sequence learning.

Gradient-boosted heads to refine action-value estimation.

4. Reinforcement Learning Module

Policy gradient / Actor-Critic methods.

Boosted ensemble of Q-networks for stability.

Hierarchical reward shaping with multi-objective optimization.
