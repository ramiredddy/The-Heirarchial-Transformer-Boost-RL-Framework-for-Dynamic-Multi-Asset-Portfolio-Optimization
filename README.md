## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

```yaml
learning_rate: 3e-4
batch_size: 256

## üìä Methodology

This framework combines three powerful approaches:

1. **Hierarchical Transformer Architecture**: Multi-head self-attention mechanisms capture complex temporal dependencies in financial time series data
2. **Gradient Boosting Integration**: XGBoost enhances feature extraction and provides robust prediction signals
3. **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: Stable reinforcement learning algorithm for continuous action spaces in portfolio allocation

The model processes historical price data, technical indicators, and market microstructure features through transformer layers, then uses PPO to optimize portfolio weights while maintaining transaction cost awareness.

                                                     v

                                    +----------------+----------------+
                                    |                                 |
                                [Actor]                           [Critic]
                            (Policy Network)                (Value Network)
                                    |
                                    v
                            [Portfolio Weights]
```

The architecture consists of multiple attention heads that process temporal sequences, followed by gradient boosting for feature enhancement, and finally a PPO-based actor-critic network for action generation.

## üéØ Evaluation Metrics

The framework performance is evaluated using the following key metrics:

- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns measuring excess return per unit of volatility
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline during the investment period
- **Cumulative Returns**: Total portfolio return over the evaluation period
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trading periods
- **Sortino Ratio**: Downside risk-adjusted return (penalizes only negative volatility)
- **Information Ratio**: Active return relative to benchmark divided by tracking error
- **Calmar Ratio**: Annual return divided by maximum drawdown

All metrics are computed on out-of-sample test data to ensure robust evaluation.

## üöÄ Usage Example

Here's a quick example to get you started:

```python
import numpy as np
from portfolio_optimizer import HierarchicalTransformerPPO

# Initialize the model
model = HierarchicalTransformerPPO(
    n_assets=10,
    learning_rate=3e-4,
    transformer_layers=6,
    attention_heads=8
)

# Load your market data
market_data = np.load('market_data.npy')  # Shape: (timesteps, n_assets, features)

# Train the model
model.train(
    data=market_data,
    epochs=100,
    batch_size=256
)

# Generate portfolio weights for new data
new_data = np.load('test_data.npy')
portfolio_weights = model.predict(new_data)

print(f"Optimal portfolio weights: {portfolio_weights}")
```
